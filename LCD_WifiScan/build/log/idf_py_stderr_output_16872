CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory E:/ESP32_jlc/03-esp32_mypro/LCD_WifiScan/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory e:/ESP32_jlc/03-esp32_mypro/LCD_LVGL/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "E:/ESP32_jlc/03-esp32_mypro/LCD_WifiScan/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "E:/ESP32_jlc/03-esp32_mypro/LCD_LVGL/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
